# Contributing to KAL

`KAL` aims to overcome the problem of incomplete authorization listing in Kubernetes Clusters. This issue is most related to custom authorization endpoints, which sometimes does not inform an authorization response ([see more here](https://raesene.github.io/blog/2024/04/22/Fun-with-Kubernetes-Authz/)).

We're very much open to contributions but there are some things to keep in mind:

- Discuss the feature and implementation you want to add on Github before you write a PR for it. On disagreements, maintainer(s) will have the final word.
- Features need a somewhat general use case. If the use case is very niche it will be hard for us to consider maintaining it.
- If youâ€™re going to add a feature, consider if you could help out in the maintenance of it.
- When issues or pull requests are not going to be resolved or merged, they should be closed as soon as possible. This is kinder than deciding this after a long period. Our issue tracker should reflect work to be done.

That said, there are many ways to contribute to KAL, including:

- Contribution to code
- Improving the documentation
- Reviewing merge requests
- Investigating bugs
- Reporting issues
